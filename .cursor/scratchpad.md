# Miden Telegram Bot Project

## Background and Motivation
- Create a Telegram bot that can answer questions about the Miden project
- Use Groq for AI processing and crawl4ai for web scraping
- Bot should be able to process any Miden documentation page and provide accurate answers

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Web Scraping
   - Need to handle dynamic content
   - Must remove headers and footers
   - Need to maintain context and structure of content

2. AI Integration
   - Efficient processing of scraped content
   - Accurate response generation
   - Context management for follow-up questions

3. Telegram Bot Implementation
   - Handle user interactions
   - Process URLs and questions
   - Manage conversation state

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. [ ] Project Setup
   - [ ] Initialize Node.js project
   - [ ] Install required dependencies
   - [ ] Set up environment variables
   - [ ] Create basic project structure

2. [ ] Web Scraping Implementation
   - [ ] Implement crawl4ai integration
   - [ ] Create content cleaning functions
   - [ ] Test scraping with sample Miden docs

3. [ ] AI Integration

   - [ ] Implement content processing
   - [ ] Create response generation logic

4. [ ] Telegram Bot Development
   - [ ] Create basic bot structure
   - [ ] Implement URL handling
   - [ ] Add question processing
   - [ ] Implement conversation management

5. [ ] Testing and Refinement
   - [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
   - [ ] Optimize response quality
   - [ ] Add error handling
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting

## Project Status Board

- [x] Dependencies setup
- [x] Basic bot structure
- [x] Web scraping implementation
- [x] AI integration
- [ ] Testing and deployment

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The basic implementation is complete. The bot now has the following features:
1. Web scraping with header/footer removal
2. Groq AI integration for question answering
3. Basic error handling and user feedback
4. URL and question parsing

Next steps:
1. Test the bot with various Miden documentation pages
2. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Implement better error handling for specific cases
4. Add support for follow-up questions

## Lessons
1. When installing npm packages, always verify the correct package names and versions
2. Use environment variables for sensitive information (API keys, tokens)
3. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
4. Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations
5. Keep the code modular and maintainable
